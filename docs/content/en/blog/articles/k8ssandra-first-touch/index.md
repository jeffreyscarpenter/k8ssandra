This live demo shows you how to run an Apache CassandraÂ® cluster in Kubernetes using K8ssandra. Steps include: installing a cluster using Helm, configuring ingress using Traefik, checking that the installation is running correctly, explanation of each pod included in K8ssandra, viewing metrics using Prometheus and Grafana, and running repairs with Reaper. 

For more information on installing K8ssandra and first use, check out the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/).
