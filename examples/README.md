# K8ssandra Examples

This directory provides example K8ssandra deployments that demonstrate various configuration options.

We welcome additional examples submitted via pull request according to the [code contribution guidelines](https://k8ssandra.io/community/code-contribution-guidelines/). Each example should provide `yaml` or other configuration files, and a `README` that lists any prerequisites and gives clear instructions on how to apply the configuration.
